# Disaster-analysis

## Summary of the project 
This work is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. This project is in cooperation with Figure Eight. In this project, we will analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The project is divided into three parts:

1. ETL Pipeline

- In a Python script, process_data.py, write a data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the messages and categories datasets
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a SQLite database

2. ML Pipeline

- In a Python script, train_classifier.py, write a machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the SQLite database
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs results on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

3. Flask Web App
